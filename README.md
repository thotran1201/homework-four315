For this fourth assignment I did in class, I created this website with "The Matrix" Themed site with modal or alert. I also developed the login or sign-in sheet on both of the login.html and index.html. Speaking of index.html, when you clicked on the login button on the home page, it will show you the login pop-up that lets you sign in with your username and password. Once it's successfully logged in, the message will pop up and it will shows up with a "you logged in" successfully.
